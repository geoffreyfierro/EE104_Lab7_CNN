In order to run the Lab 7 CNN python files, the follwing python packages must be installed: tensorflow, keras, and matplotlib.

In addition, this program also requires the use of NVIDIA CUDA and NVIDIA CUDNN unless the code is being run on GoogleColab

The steps used to set up the Visual Studio Code environment with tensorflow, Cuda, and Cudnn were followed from this video by Derek Banas: https://youtu.be/EmZZsy7Ym-4

This program constructs and trains a CNN, convolutional neural network using the keras tensorflow libraries.  This neural network is able to identify the classification of an image among the following catergories with a 91% accuracy:
Airplanes
Automobiles
Birds
Cats
Deer
Dogs
Frogs
Horses
Ships
Trucks

A screen shot of the final AI training epochs is attached, and a video of the last 5 minutes of the training as well as the validation using 5 selected challenge images will be provided in the links below.
